<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Welcome! My name is Desiree and I am from Boston, Massachusetts. I've been in the finance and accounting field for 
  most of my career and am ready for a change. I am currently enrolled in a bachelor's degree in computer 
  science program. I'm also taking a few tech courses on Udemy in different areas of tech to figure out what area of tech I enjoy working in.
   After completing my degree, my goal is to get a remote job and become a digital nomad.

<p>In my last position as an internal auditor, I traveled 50% of the time to many countries in Africa, Southeast Asia and in between
  from the US which fueled my love for travel. When not on an assignment, I would wake up and head to the office and sit in my cubicle 
  for 8-10 hours a day. During the COVID pandemic, the company I worked for went completely remote. After working remotely, I knew I would
  I could never work in an office setting again.

<p>I am excited about my journey to becoming a software developer or cybersecurity analyst. I am looking forward to wear this road will lead. 
  As an accountant I did not get to explore my creative side by just punching numers all day.  I'm excited to share the 
  cool projects and content I will be  creating and posting on my site.</p>
