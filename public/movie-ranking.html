<h1>The Best Animes According to Desiree</h1>
<h2>My top three animes of all time.</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Naruto</h3>
<p>It's action packed, inspirational and kid friendly.</p>
<h3>Bleach</h3>
<p>For older kids, full of action with a sci-fi feel and also has positive messages.</p>
<h3>Kengan Ashura</h3>
<p>This one is not for kids. There's a lot of foul language, sexual situations, gore, and tournament fighting.</p>
